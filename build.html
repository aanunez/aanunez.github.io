<p>So I finally got around to creating some kind of website and, as I'm sure its obvious, I did pretty much the bare minimum. I don't much care for more complex websites and I've always been a fan of <a href="https://stallman.org/">Stallman's</a> sans the clutter. This whole thing is just a single HTML file with three lines of CSS, these posts are generated via <a href="http://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> from markdown. The whole thing is then wrapped in a python script to easily manage the multiple files, and tacking on the header / footer. Not sure why I never thought of this before.</p>
